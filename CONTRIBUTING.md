We are happy to receive template contributions for apps and games that we do not currently  support ourselves. 
If you would like to contribute and submit a Pull Request, please make sure that you follow the naming & formatting structure in the ['templates'](https://github.com/neatodev/InstallDebloater/tree/main/templates) folder. 
Please also make sure to only submit one application/game as a commit at a time.
