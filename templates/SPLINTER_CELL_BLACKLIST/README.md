# Install Debloater for Splinter Cell: Blacklist

This template is designed to work with Splinter Cell: Blacklist. Tested on the Steam version. 
- Removes all languages except English

## Installation

Download the "SPLINTER_CELL_BLACKLIST" folder here and put the folder next to InstallDebloater.exe. Run the program either through PowerShell/Commandline.

## Usage

First, open SPLINTER_CELL_BLACKLIST.ini with a text editor and add the complete filepath to your game root folder (example: C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Blacklist).

For both commandline and batch methods, use the following syntax:

```bash
.\InstallDebloater.exe SPLINTER_CELL_BLACKLIST/SPLINTER_CELL_BLACKLIST.ini
```
This will run the script.
If you want to keep some languages, take a look at the SPLINTER_CELL_BLACKLIST_NAMING_SCHEME.txt. All languages are isolated, just comment the lines related to the language(s) you want to keep.
