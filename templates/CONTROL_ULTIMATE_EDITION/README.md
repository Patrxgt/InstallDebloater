## Installation

[Download](https://github.com/neatodev/InstallDebloater/blob/main/templates/CONTROL_ULTIMATE_EDITION/CONTROL_ULTIMATE_EDITION.zip) and put the folder next to InstallDebloater.exe. Run the program either through PowerShell/Commandline or using the provided batch file.

## Usage

First, open CONTROL_ULTIMATE_EDITION.ini with a text editor and add the complete filepath to your game root folder (example: C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Control Ultimate Edition).

For both commandline and batch methods, use the following syntax:

```bash
.\InstallDebloater.exe CONTROL_ULTIMATE_EDITION\CONTROL_ULTIMATE_EDITION.ini
```
This will run the script.
If you want to keep some languages, take a look at the CONTROL_ULTIMATE_EDITION_NAMING_SCHEME.txt template. All languages are isolated, just comment the lines related to the language(s) you want to keep.
