# Install Debloater for Mirror's Edge

This template is designed to work with Mirror's Edge. Should work with all versions of the game and was tested on the Steam version. 
- Removes all languages except English.
- Removes all redists.
- Removes all startup movies that play before reaching the main menu (Publisher logos etc.).

Expected saving: 5.9% (435Mb).

## Installation

[Download](https://github.com/neatodev/InstallDebloater/blob/main/templates/MIRRORS_EDGE/MIRRORS_EDGE.zip) and put the folder next to InstallDebloater.exe. Run the program either through PowerShell/Commandline or using the provided batch file.

## Usage

First, open MIRRORS_EDGE.ini with a text editor and add the complete filepath to your game root folder (example: C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Mirror's Edge).

For both commandline and batch methods, use the following syntax:

```bash
.\InstallDebloater.exe MIRRORS_EDGE\MIRRORS_EDGE.ini
```
This will run the script.
If you want to keep some languages, take a look at the MIRRORS_EDGE_NAMING_SCHEME.txt template. All languages are isolated, just comment the lines related to the language(s) you want to keep.
