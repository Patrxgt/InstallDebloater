# Install Debloater for Grand Theft Auto IV: Complete Edition

This template is designed to work Grand Theft Auto IV: Complete Edition. Should work with all versions of the game and was tested on the Steam version. 
- Removes redistriuables.
- Removes Manuals.

Expected saving: 1.92% (440.51Mb).

NOTE: Since the Rockstar Game Launcher gets updated frequently, it will be re-downloaded even if you deleted it using this template. It is about 200mb. However, you can always run this script each time you see an update on Steam to remove it until the next update. 

## Installation

[Download](https://github.com/neatodev/InstallDebloater/blob/main/templates/GTA_IV_COMPLETE_EDITION/GTA_IV_COMPLETE_EDITION.zip) and put the folder next to InstallDebloater.exe. Run the program either through PowerShell/Commandline or using the provided batch file.

## Usage

First, open GTA_IV_COMPLETE_EDITION.ini with a text editor and add the complete filepath to your game root folder (example: C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto IV).

For both commandline and batch methods, use the following syntax:

```bash
.\InstallDebloater.exe GTA_IV_COMPLETE_EDITION\GTA_IV_COMPLETE_EDITIONini
```
This will run the script.
