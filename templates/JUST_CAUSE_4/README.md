# Install Debloater for Just Cause 4

This template is designed to work with Just Cause 4. Should work with all versions of the game and was tested on the Steam version. 
- Removes all languages except English.

Expected saving: 10.53% (~7.5Gb)

## Installation

[Download](https://github.com/neatodev/InstallDebloater/blob/main/templates/JUST_CAUSE_4/JUST_CAUSE_4.zip) and put the folder next to InstallDebloater.exe. Run the program either through PowerShell/Commandline or using the provided batch file.

## Usage

First, open JUST_CAUSE_4.ini with a text editor and add the complete filepath to your game root folder (example: C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Just Cause 4).

For both commandline and batch methods, use the following syntax:

```bash
.\InstallDebloater.exe JUST_CAUSE_4\JUST_CAUSE_4.ini
```
This will run the script.
If you want to keep some languages, take a look at the JUST_CAUSE_4_NAMING_SCHEME.txt template. All languages are isolated, just comment the lines related to the language(s) you want to keep.
