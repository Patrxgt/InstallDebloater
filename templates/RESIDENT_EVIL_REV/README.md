# Install Debloater for Resident Evil Revelations

This template is designed to work with Resident Evil Revelations.
- Removes unused languages files (aka "Localizations").
- Removes Japanese voice files - Japanese text files are critical and will not be deleted. 
## Installation

[Download](https://github.com/neatodev/InstallDebloater/blob/main/templates/RESIDENT_EVIL_REV/RESIDENT_EVIL_REV.zip) and put the folder next to InstallDebloater.exe. Run the program either through PowerShell/Commandline or using the provided batch file.

## Usage

First, open RESIDENT_EVIL_REV.ini with a text editor and add the complete filepath to your game root folder (example: C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Resident Evil Revelations).

For both commandline and batch methods, use the following syntax:

```bash
.\InstallDebloater.exe RESIDENT_EVIL_REV\RESIDENT_EVIL_REV.ini
```
This will run the script.
If you want to keep some languages, take a look at both RESIDENT_EVIL_REV_NAMING_SCHEME.txt and RESIDENT_EVIL_REV_FOLDER.txt templates. All languages are isolated, just comment the lines related to the language(s) you want to keep. 

## Contributing
You are welcome to contribute by making your own templates or improve existing ones. However, please make sure you're not trying to delete critical files.
