# Install Debloater for Max Payne 3

This template is designed to work with Max Payne 3. Should work with all versions of the game and was tested on the Steam version. 
- Removes multiplayer & co-op DLCs.
- Removes some redistributables.

## Installation

[Download](https://github.com/neatodev/InstallDebloater/blob/main/templates/MAX_PAYNE_3/MAX_PAYNE_3.zip) and put the folder next to InstallDebloater.exe. Run the program either through PowerShell/Commandline or using the provided batch file.

## Usage

First, open MAX_PAYNE_3.ini with a text editor and add the complete filepath to your game root folder (example: C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Max Payne 3).

For both commandline and batch methods, use the following syntax:

```bash
.\InstallDebloater.exe MAX_PAYNE_3\MAX_PAYNE_3.ini
```
This will run the script.
