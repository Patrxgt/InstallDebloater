# Install Debloater for The Evil Within

This template is designed to work with The Evil Within. Should work with all versions of the game and was tested on the Steam version. 
- Removes all languages except English.

## Installation

[Download](https://github.com/neatodev/InstallDebloater/blob/main/templates/EVIL_WITHIN/EVIL_WITHIN.zip) and put the folder next to InstallDebloater.exe. Run the program either through PowerShell/Commandline or using the provided batch file.

## Usage

First, open EVIL_WITHIN.ini with a text editor and add the complete filepath to your game root folder (example: C:\Steam\steamapps\common\The Evil Within).

For both commandline and batch methods, use the following syntax:

```bash
.\InstallDebloater.exe EVIL_WITHIN\EVIL_WITHIN.ini
```
This will run the script.
If you want to keep some languages, take a look at the EVIL_WITHIN_NAMING_SCHEME.txt template. All languages are isolated, just comment the lines related to the language(s) you want to keep.
